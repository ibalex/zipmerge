== ZipMerge Project ==

A small wrapper to the libraries ZipFile & PyPDF2.  It provides an api allowing one can pass in a list of tuples in the form of (<source file path>, <destination file path>).  If the destination file is a pdf but then the source file must also be pdf.  However, if the destination file is a zip then the source files can be a directory, zip, or virtually any file type.  The return value will be a list of the new files that were created... There should be a new file created for each unique destination path in the list of tuples.
